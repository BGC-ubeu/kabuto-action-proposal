## Abstract

Issuance of `.hyc` as a TLD on the KNS protocol.

## Rationale

Hedera Yacht Club's aim is to be the most exclusive yacht club built on the Hedera Network. It is a community-driven endeavor that strives to create a blue-chip NFT project whose main priority is to reward token holders, give back to the community, and grow the ecosystem. It aims to be the 1st Yacht Club cruising on web3 with actual businesses in real life ("IRL") and connections to the IRL yachting industry. The project was born out of the desire to create real utility for holders, to strengthen the community, and support an ocean based charity. Community members desire to identify themselves with the Hedera Yacht Club project, justifying the `.hyc` TLD.
